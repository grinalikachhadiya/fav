            <h2>How We Met</h2>
            <p>
                Honestly, there was no plan from God that we’d end up here — if there had been,
                you wouldn't have called anyone to class, and to be honest, I thought you were a
                bit full of yourself back then. But even then, you never really spoke much,
                which is why I told you, “At least read something!” That’s how our conversations
                slowly began.
                <br><br>
                At that time, I was quite bored and annoyed with everything,
                so I asked you for your earbuds — but in my heart, I had already decided:
                <i> If you offered them again the next day, we’d definitely meet and talk properly.</i>
                <br><br>
                And guess what? The very next day, you gave me your buds.
                <br><br>
                That one small gesture made me unexpectedly happy — and right then,
                somewhere deep inside… I started to like you. 💖

            <h2>Our First Date</h2>
            <p class="event-date">Sunday, June 8</p>
            <p>
                Our first day was amazing. We spent time together in the garden,
                and we even watched the same movie twice—just because we wanted to spend
                more time together at the theatre. Every moment was truly special.
                <br><br>
                Later, we even spent the night together. There were a few small issues at night,
                but honestly, I forgot all of them the moment you fell asleep in my arms.
                Just looking at you brought peace to my heart. How can someone be this loving
                and sweet? It feels unreal. 🫶🏻✨

            <h2>Trips & Memories</h2>
            <p>
                We never really went on grand trips — but for us, even the garden felt like an escape.
                <br><br>
                Because we couldn't go out much together, even the smallest moments felt like adventures.
                To me, the garden was not just a garden… it was our trip, our little world.
                <br><br>
                Some places will always be special, no matter how simple they are.
                Like the BRTS stop, TRP Mall, Movie theatre, and that quiet garden — they aren’t just locations…
                They are where my heart found peace with you. ❤️

            <p>
                I always joke around and tease you saying, “Baby, all my sins must’ve been washed away, that’s why I found you!”
                But honestly... deep down, I truly mean it.
                <br><br>
                I feel incredibly lucky — because you're not just someone I met...
                <br>
